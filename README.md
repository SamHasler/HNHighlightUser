===============

This is a simple Greasemonkey script to highlight comments of a single author inside of Hacker News threads.  The scripts adds a "highlight" link next to each comment.  Clicking the link will highlight every comment by that author with light grey.  Highlighting can be toggled back off by clicking "highlight" again.

Simple, but effective :)
