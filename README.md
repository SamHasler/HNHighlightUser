===============

This is a simple Greasemonkey script to highlight posts of a single author inside of Hacker News threads.  The scripts adds a "highlight" link next to each post.  Clicking the link will highlight every post by that author with light grey.  Highlighting can be toggled back off by clicking "highlight" again.

Simple, but effective :)
